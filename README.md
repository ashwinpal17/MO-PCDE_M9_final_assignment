## Required Final Assignment 9.1 (Part 2): GitHub and Advanced Python Functions

This repository contains my submission for the final assignment in Module 9.  
The notebook demonstrates knowledge of advanced Python concepts including:

- Python classes  
- Functions with variable numbers of arguments  
- Decorators and wrappers  
- GitHub version control workflow

## Assignment Steps Completed
1. Downloaded the Jupyter Notebook from Codio.  
2. Created this repository and made it public.  
3. Cloned the repository locally and added the Notebook file.  
4. Edited the Notebook to include my full name.  
5. Committed and pushed changes back to GitHub.

## Self-Study Discussion 9.1 Reflection

During this module, I explored resources that helped me better understand both GitHub and advanced Python functions.  

One resource I found helpful was the GitHub documentation. It gave me a clear step-by-step explanation of how to create repositories, clone them, commit changes, and push updates. This was especially useful for the GitHub portion of the final assignment, where I needed to make sure my repository was public and my commits were organized properly.  

I also came across an article on Real Python that explained Python decorators in a very straightforward way. It started with simple examples and then moved to more advanced ones, which made the concept of functions as first-class objects easier to understand. This connected directly with our work on decorators and wrappers in this module.  

Another resource that supported me was a GeeksforGeeks article on Python classes and object-oriented programming. It offered short and clear code examples that made it easier to review OOP concepts and apply them when practicing class-based exercises.  

As a tip, Iâ€™ve started keeping my own repository of useful links and cheat sheets in GitHub. I organize them into topics such as Git commands, Python classes, and decorators. This way, I can revisit them later and also build a personal library of references as I continue my data engineering journey.
